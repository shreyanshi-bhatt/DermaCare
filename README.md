# Project Description

"DermaCare-Skin Disease Classification" is a cutting-edge web application aimed at transforming dermatological care delivery. Our platform seamlessly connects patients with dermatologists, facilitating efficient diagnosis, consultation, and treatment management.

Patients benefit from a user-friendly interface where they can securely log in and submit comprehensive reports detailing their medical history, concerns, and previous prescriptions. These reports are swiftly directed to their chosen dermatologist for review and response.

A standout feature of DermaCare is its advanced AI-driven skin disease classification system. Users, whether patients or doctors, can effortlessly upload images of affected skin areas for rapid diagnosis using a bespoke deep learning model. This technology enhances diagnostic accuracy and expedites treatment planning.

DermaCare prioritizes usability and security, offering intuitive navigation for both patients and dermatologists while ensuring stringent data privacy measures. By seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art technology with dermatological care, DermaCare represents a significant leap forward in telemedicine, empowering patients to access personalized care from anywhere, while enabling dermatologists to provide timely and efficient consultations.
